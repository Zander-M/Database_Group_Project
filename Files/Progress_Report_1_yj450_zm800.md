## Team Member Roles

For the moment, Yijian Liu focuses on the front-end design and Zander Mao focuses on the back-end server structure. We both contribute to database design.

## Time Schedule

So far we've designed the basic structure of the project. There are four stages of the project: user management (login/logout/register), user functions (depending on the role of the user), front-end design(make the web pages more user-friendly) By April 27 (Saturday) we'll finish implementing the user management system and also design every required SQL queries. By May 1 we'll finish implementing the functions for different users. By May 4 we'll have a primitive design of th web page. We'll spend some time to refine it before the deadline.

## Current Problem

Back-end: for the moment, we are storing all the page rendering functions in one file. It works, but it's hard to manage. We are looking for ways to reorganize the project.

## Cases Completed

We've implemented the database, some basic login/logout/register functions and the homepage for different user.

## Database Progress

Yes, we've created the tables in the database. We plan to modify it's structure a little bit and add several fields for security reasons.

## Data Insertion

Yes, we inserted some test cases in the database. We are planning to add more in the database for testing.
